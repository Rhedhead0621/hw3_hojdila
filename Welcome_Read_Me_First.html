<h2>Team Member</h2>
<p>Anna Hojdila</p>
<h2>Project Title</h2>
<p>ChatBot Development through web and PDF scraping</p>
<h2>Type of Final Project</h2>
<p>Based on Module 5 - Data wrangling / visualizations / analysis</p>
<h2>Executive Summary of the Project</h2>
<p>This project has morphed from the original plan, however the problem-solving of roadblocks led to discovering other options and work-arounds just as interesting.</p>
<p>Initial Primary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Python to Webscrape data to use with a chatbot</li>
<li>Develop a chatbot that interacts with information from the data</li>
</ul>

<h2>Data Needs and Sources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Chatbot platform such as Landbot - decided to remain within Python and use NLTK package</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges and Reality Checks</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Webscraping data requiring login information is challenging, especially when I'm finally successful entering my email address and selecting the "Next" button through the code, only to get to a Google login requirement needing to text my cell phone and enter a random texted number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another idea was taking information from a PDF, and using the text information for the chatbot - this requires OCR (Optical Character Recognition) within Python (I thought Python would magically know an A was an A, not a picture of an A...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The text data would be used to build the intents (user inputs) and responses (chatbot output) within a chatbot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn something more about these "intents" and "responses" everyone keeps mentioning</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does it take to build a chatbot??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landbot looks interesting...wait, they want me to load a question and response one at a time?? Ok, I can use DialogFlow but that's not free...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Need free, <em>Now</em> what chatbot platform should I use?? Let's just look at Python options</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did the Python Chatterbot crash my Anaconda?? Now I have to learn how to uncrash Anaconda...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's not use Python Chatterbot...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accomplishments and Personal Learning</h2>
<p>Main chatbot source, I started with their code and ideas, and modified it along the way:</p>

<p>Basic project process flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>1_Selenium_Plus_BS_Final.ipynb: access a webpage and scrape the html data</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2_Selenium_Final.ipynb: access a webpage and scrape the clean text off the page</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3_OCR_Final.ipynb: scrape text off a PDF using OCR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>4_NLTK_aap_troubleshooting.ipynb: this is the first time I've experienced issues installing packages. I also am not able to create a virtual environment, so I will need to work on troubleshooting that. This file shows which packages I had to install using %pip install. These packages need to be installed before working on the rest of the notebooks.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>5_Cleaning_keywordExtraction_Final.ipynb: clean a text document and extract keywords</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>6_NLTK_Basic_Rule_Chatbot_Final.ipynb: runs a very basic, pop up chatbot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>7_GUI_chatbox_Final.ipynb: runs the very basic intents/responses, in a GUI pop up chatbot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>8_md_to_html.ipynb: converts .md file to .html file</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Resources.md: documented most of the websites used or read through</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The plan was to scrape text from the web or PDF, to use for the final intents/reponses - this is much harder than I thought it would be, but I still think it's possible and I'm still going to pursue options to implement a chatbot at work. I am going to build the landbot version, but it may not involve using Python.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The final chatbot was going to have the paired responses from a json file - the json file repeatedly imported as a list instead of a dictionary, I'm moving on and putting that on my to do list.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project doesn't focus on one website or PDF for a final example, however the basic steps to begin are included, after much trial and error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>I also would like to launch the chatbot from an html document</p>
</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>Chatbots can also store the "conversations" for further learning and analyzing topics for enhanced customer service (what are the highest ranking questions, issues, topics, etc.) </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learned more about markdown and html formatting - very cool site! </p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>I learned a lot from the course modules, however this final project immersed and reinforced the content we covered:</p>
<ul>
<li>Importance of knowing the data - is it string, number, list, dictionary?</li>
<li>Defining functions</li>
<li>Looking at a starting template and knowing what to change along with how to change it</li>
<li>I've needed a way to manipulate text from a PDF invoice we have to manually reference monthly; I should be able to scrape the VIN, item and dollar amount into a table, which is a process we have needed for a few years - very excited about that</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>
<p>chromedriver: chromedriver was necessary for connecting Selenium with Chrome</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>data: data files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>docs: text and PDF files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>images: image files</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>notebook_trials: all the trials used along the way</p>
<p>-- ForProfOnly: copy of the notebook that works through the required email step, stops and doesn't complete the Google login portion. It's not highly sensitive, but it references a corporate site</p>
