<h1>Advanced Analytics with Python â€“ Final Project</h1>
<h2>Team Member</h2>
<p>Anna Hojdila</p>
<h2>Project Title</h2>
<p>ChatBot Development through web and PDF scraping</p>
<h2>Type of Final Project</h2>
<p>Based on Module 5 - Data wrangling / visualizations / analysis</p>
<h2>Executive Summary of the Project</h2>
<p>This project has morphed slightly from the original plan, however the problem-solving of roadblocks led to discovering other options just as interesting - and provided work-arounds to flow from start to finish.</p>
<p>Initial Primary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Python to Webscrape data to use with a chatbot</li>
<li>Develop a chatbot that interacts with information from the data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Needs and Sources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Chatbot platform such as Landbot</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges and Reality Checks</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Webscraping data requiring login information is challenging, especially when I'm finally successful entering my email address and selecting the "Next" button through the code, only to get to a Google login requirement needing to text my cell phone and enter a random texted number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another idea was taking information from a PDF, and using the text information for the chatbot - this requires OCR (Optical Character Recognition) within Python (I thought Python would magically know an A was an A, not a picture of an A...)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ultimately, I'll be using the text data to build the questions and responses within a chatbot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does it take to build a chatbot??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landbot looks interesting...wait, they want me to load a question and response one at a time?? Ok, I can use DialogFlow but that's not free...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something about "intents" and "responses"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Now</em> what chatbot platform should I use??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did the Python Chatterbot crash my Anaconda?? Now I have to learn how to uncrash Anaconda...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's not use Python Chatterbot...</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Accomplishments and Personal Learning</h2>
<p>Basic project process flow:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Research and decide on chatbot option - settled on NLTK Library in Python</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Web and PDF scrape for chatbot topics</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Develop a table that holds intents and responses with data from web and PDF scraping - aka keyword extraction</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be able to launch the chatbot from an html document</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Learn more about markdown and html formatting</p>
</li>
</ul>
