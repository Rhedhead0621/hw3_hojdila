While possession of a valid driver's license is a minimum requirement, Company Vehicle
Operations reserves to its sole discretion the final determination of whether a particular
driving record presents an unacceptable risk that disqualifies a driver from eligibility for
participation in its Programs.

The Company requires an annual motor vehicle record (MVR) review for all
eligible company vehicle drivers, including dependent drivers. Before
Employee participants can obtain a vehicle, current MVRs must be reviewed
and approved for all drivers. This process is automated through our vendor,
CEI and is a mandatory requirement. The MVR results will be reviewed by
Company Vehicle Operations. As the Employee participant, you will be
charged for the cost of the MVR review for yourself and your dependent
drivers. The cost is the same as your local Secretary of State or DMV. The fee
will be payroll deducted within two pay periods. Note: MVRs obtained directly
from Secretary of State/DMV will no longer be accepted. We also do NOT
accept third party (i.e. on-line service, insurance companies, etc.) or noncertified driver histories.

Fully licensed dependent(s), between the ages of 16-19 are required to
participate in the Road Ready Teen Program by reading and signing the Road
Ready Parent/Teen Contract before they can be added as an eligible driver in
the program. Dependents with a drivers’ or learner’s permit are not required to
participate in the Road Ready Teen Program until they receive a valid driver
license. When driving with a drivers’ permit, it is a Company Vehicle
Operations requirement to drive with at least one (1) parent or legal guardian
at all times.

Reporting Requirements:

Employee Participants are required to notify Company Vehicle Operations if their vehicle
is approaching 30,000 miles so that a replacement vehicle can be ordered.

Employee Participants are required to report to Company Vehicle Operations within 72
hours (or if not possible, as soon thereafter as possible) and also send a written
explanation, if any of the following driving related issues occur:

The driver's license of the Employee participant or any of the Employee
participant's dependent drivers becomes restricted or suspended.

Drug or alcohol related incidents, involving the Employee participant or any
other eligible driver, including MIPs (Minor in Possession), that may limit,
restrict, jeopardize, or otherwise effect an eligible driver's ability to safely or
legally operate a motor vehicle.

Accidents involving the participant or any other eligible driver resulting in
serious bodily injury or death. Any incident involving a third party or property
