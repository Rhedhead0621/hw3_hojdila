Project Title
-------------
ChatBot Development through web and PDF scraping

Type of Final Project
---------------------
Based on Module 5 - Data wrangling / visualizations / analysis

Executive Summary of the Project
-----------------------------------------

This project has morphed slightly from the original plan, however the problem-solving of roadblocks led to discovering other options just as interesting - and provided work-arounds to flow from start to finish.

Initial Primary Goals:

- Use Python to Webscrape data to use with a chatbot
- Develop a chatbot that interacts with information from the data


Data Needs and Sources
-----------------------
- Python
- Chatbot platform such as Landbot

Challenges and Reality Checks
-----------------------------

- Webscraping data requiring login information is challenging, especially when I'm finally successful entering my email address and selecting the "Next" button through the code, only to get to a Google login requirement needing to text my cell phone and enter a random texted number

- Another idea was taking information from a PDF, and using the text information for the chatbot - this requires OCR (Optical Character Recognition) within Python (I thought Python would magically know an A was an A, not a picture of an A...)

- Ultimately, I'll be using the text data to build the questions and responses within a chatbot

- What does it take to build a chatbot??

- Landbot looks interesting...wait, they want me to load a question and response one at a time?? Ok, I can use DialogFlow but that's not free...

- Something about "intents" and "responses"

- *Now* what chatbot platform should I use??

- Why did the Python Chatterbot crash my Anaconda?? Now I have to learn how to uncrash Anaconda...

- Let's not use Python Chatterbot...

Accomplishments and Personal Learning
-------------------------------------

Basic project process flow:

- Research and decide on chatbot option - settled on NLTK Library in Python

- Web and PDF scrape for chatbot topics

- Develop a table that holds intents and responses with data from web and PDF scraping - aka keyword extraction

- Be able to launch the chatbot from an html document

Personal learning:

- Learn more about markdown and html formatting

Chatbots can also store the "conversations" for further learning and analyzing topics for enhanced customer service (what are the highest ranking questions, issues, topics, etc.)
