<h2>Project Title</h2>
<p>ChatBot Development through web and PDF scraping</p>
<h2>Type of Final Project</h2>
<p>Based on Module 5 - Data wrangling / visualizations / analysis</p>
<h2>Executive Summary of the Project</h2>
<p>This project has morphed slightly from the original plan, however the problem-solving of roadblocks led to discovering other options just as interesting - and provided work-arounds to flow from start to finish.</p>
<p>Initial Primary Goals:</p>
<ul>
<li>Use Python to Webscrape data to use with a chatbot</li>
<li>Develop a chatbot that interacts with information from the data</li>
</ul>
<h2>Data Needs and Sources</h2>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>Chatbot platform such as Landbot</li>
</ul>
<h2>Challenges and Reality Checks</h2>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Webscraping data requiring login information is challenging, especially when I'm finally successful entering my email address and selecting the "Next" button, only to get to a Google login requirement needing to text and enter a random texted number</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Another idea was taking information from a PDF, and using the text information for the chatbot - this requires OCR (Optical Character Recognition) within Python</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ultimately, I'll be using the text data to build the questions and responses within a chatbot</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What does it take to build a chatbot??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Landbot looks interesting...wait, they want me to load a question and response one at a time?? Ok, I can use DialogFlow but that's not free...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Something about "intents" and "responses"</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Now what chatbot platform should I use??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why did the Python Chatterbot crash my Anaconda??</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Let's not use Python Chatterbot...</p>
</li>
</ul>
