COMPANY DISCRETION... eee eeeeeeeeeneeeees  BASIC PROVISIONS  Product Evaluation (PE) Program  Length of Term One model year. Stellantis may request or require  that the Employee participant replace the Product Evaluation vehicle more frequently.  Executive roll employees, Senior Managers and above A newly promoted or eligible employee who Eligibility has a lease vehicle must have it converted to a PE vehicle effective the date of the promotion. If an employee is demoted below senior manager status or terminated, he/she will be  immediately ineligible for this program.  Number of 1 PE vehicle Vehicles Allowed  Note re: Employee Lease (EL) vehicles - Employee participants with a PE vehicle in service must have at least one additional approved driver if they wish to activate an Employee Lease vehicle, at least two additional approved drivers for a second lease vehicle and at least three additional approved drivers for a third lease vehicle.  Revised June 5, 2024  Vehicle Lease (EL) Program  The lease term for this program is 12 months (based on inservice date). The penalty for termination prior to the end of the lease is a minimum suspension from participation in the Program of one year and payroll deductions may continue for the duration of the agreed upon lease period. If an Employee participant orders a vehicle against his/her second or third lease eligibility and terminates the first or second lease vehicle (i.e. circumventing system), he/she will lose eligibility under this  e Active Professional-Administrative, Management and Executive employees.  Up to 3 EL vehicles  Employee Participant must have at least one additional approved driver to activate a second lease vehicle and at least two additional approved drivers for a third lease vehicle.  Employee Participants with a PE or Field vehicle in service must have at least one additional approved driver if they wish to activate an Employee Lease vehicle, at least two additional approved drivers for a second lease vehicle and at least three additional approved drivers for a third lease vehicle.  Authorized Use  The PE Employee participant is expected to provide his/her PE Program vehicle for business use as a pool vehicle for employees. Use of PE Program vehicles by the Employee participant\\'s spouse, Employee participant’s domestic partner or dependent children is prohibited under program rules and tax laws governing this Program. A family member who continues to meet program eligibility requirements and is currently participating in Company Vehicle Operations (i.e. through use of a leased vehicle), may use the PE vehicle on a limited basis, as long as the company executive employee remains the primary driver of the PE vehicle. Eligible dependent children under 21 are prohibited from driving the PE vehicle outside the state of residence of the parent executive employee.  PE Participants must submit all expenses associated with the operation of the PE vehicle (e.g. fuel, car washes etc.) on a business expense report.  PE participants located at a facility with on-site fuel availability are required to fuel their vehicles on site only. For PE participants located in facilities or offices without fuel availability, fuel purchases will only be reimbursed for work-related commuting and business travel. Fuel purchases related to personal use of PE vehicles (e.g. vacation travel) are not reimbursable.  All eligible family members except the employee are considered ‘dependent drivers’. Eligible family member/dependent drivers include the Employee participant’s  @ Spouse or domestic partner who is a member of the  Employee participant\\'s household.  Dependent children must be:  e by birth, legal adoption, or legal guardianship of the Employee participant, Employee participant’s spouse or Employee participant’s domestic partner until the end of the calendar year in which they turn 26. children may not be added as a new participant after they turn 26.  Fiancés/ Fiancées, girlfriends/boyfriends, parents,  household employees, in-laws, and any other family  members, etc. are not eligible family members. Employee Participants must list all eligible drivers on the Company Vehicle Ordering System and verify they are listed on the electronic Lease Agreement and Payroll Deduction Form (PDF) each time a vehicle is ordered. A current motor vehicle record (MVR) must be obtained annually via the automated MVR process for each individual.  GENERAL REQUIREMENTS AND INSTRUCTIONS  Driver Requirements:  Any driver of a company-owned vehicle is required to have: 1) a valid driver\\'s license that has been unrestricted (including pending matters resulting in restrictions) for two consecutive years before entering the program, or 2) a learner’s permit.  Revised June 5, 2024 4  While possession of a valid driver\\'s license is a minimum requirement, Company Vehicle Operations reserves to its sole discretion the final determination of whether a particular driving record presents an unacceptable risk that disqualifies a driver from eligibility for participation in its Programs.  The Company requires an annual motor vehicle record (MVR) review for all eligible company vehicle drivers, including dependent drivers. Before Employee participants can obtain a vehicle, current MVRs must be reviewed and approved for all drivers. This process is automated through our vendor, CEI and is a mandatory requirement. The MVR results will be reviewed by Company Vehicle Operations. As the Employee participant, you will be charged for the cost of the MVR review for yourself and your dependent drivers. The cost is the same as your local Secretary of State or DMV. The fee will be payroll deducted within two pay periods. Note: MVRs obtained directly from Secretary of State/DMV will no longer be accepted. We also do NOT accept third party (i.e. on-line service, insurance companies, etc.) or noncertified driver histories.  Fully licensed dependent(s), between the ages of 16-19 are required to participate in the Road Ready Teen Program by reading and signing the Road Ready Parent/Teen Contract before they can be added as an eligible driver in the program. Dependents with a drivers’ or learner’s permit are not required to participate in the Road Ready Teen Program until they receive a valid driver license. When driving with a drivers’ permit, it is a Company Vehicle Operations requirement to drive with at least one (1) parent or legal guardian at all times.  Reporting Requirements:  Employee Participants are required to notify Company Vehicle Operations if their vehicle is approaching 30,000 miles so that a replacement vehicle can be ordered.  Employee Participants are required to report to Company Vehicle Operations within 72 hours (or if not possible, as soon thereafter as possible) and also send a written explanation, if any of the following driving related issues occur:  The driver\\'s license of the Employee participant or any of the Employee participant\\'s dependent drivers becomes restricted or suspended.

LEASE PAYMENTS  Lease and insurance payments will commence on the day the Employee participant takes delivery of the vehicle. The charges will be prorated during the first and last months of the lease. A Lease Vehicle Receipt & Disclosure Form (LVR) activates and/or deactivates the monthly lease and insurance vehicle deduction. The monthly deduction is based on a thirty-day month, and is taken from an available payroll check or checking account. Employee participants will electronically sign a PE/Lease Agreement and Payroll Deduction Authorization Form permitting Stellantis to deduct from the Employee participant\\'s salary the amount of the monthly lease and insurance charges and any other charges for damage or missing equipment assessed under the terms of the Program.  Any LVR processed after the payroll cut-off date will not be reflected in the monthly deduction until the following month. If a lease and insurance payment is not taken from a Revised June 5, 2024 10  payroll check, it will be deducted from the following month\\'s payroll check in addition to the regular monthly payments. If an additional deduction is not possible, the Employee participant is responsible for paying any invoice that is issued. Payment is due immediately upon receipt of the invoice.  Whenever deductions cannot be made from the payroll check, the Employee participant must provide their financial institution\\'s account information to Company Vehicle Operations so that lease vehicle and insurance payments may be taken from a designated electronic funds transfer (EFT) account. The deduction taken from your bank account is for the usage of the vehicle in the prior month.  Monthly lease and insurance charges will continue for vehicles being repaired regardless of the duration of repairs. Monthly lease and insurance charges will continue for stolen or totaled vehicles until the file is closed allowing the vehicles to be removed from service and/or a replacement vehicle (if possible) has been delivered. The charges will be pro-rated once the vehicle has been removed from service.  lf the Employee participant defaults on the monthly lease payment for three consecutive months, a payment plan must be arranged with Company Vehicle Operations or the Employee participant may lose their eligibility to continue in the Program.  lf there are any outstanding charges that are not able to be collected, all outstanding amounts will be sent to an outside collections agency for recovery and reported to the credit bureau.  Example Calculations of Lease Payment:  Adjustments Example | Vehicle exchange occurring on May 5 (before cut-off date):  e Turn in vehicle lease and insurance rate is $300 e Replacement vehicle lease and insurance rate is $325  Turn-in vehicle usage was for 5 days in May. $300 / 30 days = $10 per day X 5 days = $50 cost to lessee  Replacement vehicle usage was 25 days in May. $325 / 30 days = $10.83 per day X 25 days = $270.83 cost to lessee  Revised June 5, 2024 1]  Lease and insurance deduction for May 31 paycheck is $50 + $270.83 = $320.83.  Example Il Vehicle exchange occurring May 22 (after cut-off date):  e Monthly lease and insurance rate of vehicle turned in is $270 e Monthly lease and insurance rate of replacement vehicle is $330  Because paperwork was received after the payroll cut-off date, the May lease and insurance deduction is $270. In June, the deduction will take into account the transaction as follows:  Vehicle turned in will be adjusted for eight days in May.  $270/30 days = $9/day X 8 days’ usage = $72 credit to the lessee  Replacement lease and insurance charge is calculated for part of May and all of June, as follows:  Replacement vehicle usage was 8 days in May (May 22 - May 30). $330 / 30 days = $11 per day X 8 days = $88 cost to lessee Replacement vehicle usage was 30 days in June=$330 cost to lessee  Lease and insurance deduction for June 30th paycheck is as follows: Total deduction for June = $88 + $330 = $418 Total credit for May in June = $72  VEHICLE TURN-IN AND DELIVERY INSTRUCTIONS  Turn-In / Delivery Policy:  The lease term for this program is 12 months (based on in-service date). The penalty for termination prior to the end of the lease is a minimum suspension of Program eligibility for one year and payroll deductions may continue for the duration of the agreed upon lease period.  Employee participant has only one lease vehicle: If the lease vehicle is turned in prior to the end of the lease, eligibility is suspended for both the first and second lease  vehicles for one year.  Employee participant has two or three lease vehicles: If one vehicle is turned in prior to the end of the lease, that lease will be subject to the above penalty for one year. The remaining lease vehicles remain unaffected.  If the Employee participant orders a vehicle against his/her second or third lease eligibility and terminates the first or second lease vehicle (i.e. circumventing system), he/she will lose eligibility under this program.
